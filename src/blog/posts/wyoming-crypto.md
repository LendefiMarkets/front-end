# The Wyoming Way: How Cynthia Lummis and the Cowboy State Are Leading America's Crypto Revolution

While Washington debates crypto policy, Wyoming and Senator Cynthia Lummis have been quietly building America's most comprehensive crypto infrastructure. From chartering the nation's first digital asset banks to preparing to launch a state-backed stablecoin, the Cowboy State has become the Delaware of crypto—and 2025 is shaping up to be their breakout year.

While most of America has spent the last few years arguing about whether cryptocurrency is legitimate, Wyoming has been busy building the future. Led by the relentless advocacy of Senator Cynthia Lummis—affectionately known as the "Bitcoin Senator"—the least populated state in the union has quietly assembled the most sophisticated crypto regulatory framework in the nation.

Now, with crypto-friendly leadership taking hold in Washington and "2025 Will Be the Year for Bitcoin and Digital Assets" according to Lummis, Wyoming's methodical approach is positioning the state to become America's undisputed crypto capital.

## **The Visionary: Senator Cynthia Lummis**

In 2013 then-Representative Cynthia Lummis first heard about a new form of currency from her daughter and son-in-law, who helped Lummis buy her first Bitcoin for $330. That $330 investment would prove to be more than financial—it was the beginning of a crusade that would reshape American crypto policy.

Fast-forward to 2025, and Lummis has become the first-ever chair of a new Senate panel devoted to digital assets. The Senate Banking Committee panel will focus on passing bipartisan legislation that boosts the industry while protecting investors, with a specific focus on market structure, stablecoins and a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Her latest achievement? Introducing the **[Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-bitcoin-act/)** in the U.S. Senate, which would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and represents the culmination of years of groundwork. The bill aims to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin—5% of the total supply—over five years, funded by reallocating existing Federal Reserve assets rather than creating new debt.

"This Bitcoin Act is going to be transformative for this country. With a strategic Bitcoin reserve, we will have an asset that, before 2045, can cut our debt in half," Lummis declared during her speech at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville.

## **Wyoming's Crypto Infrastructure: A Decade in the Making**

While Lummis provides the federal firepower, Wyoming has been methodically building the regulatory infrastructure to support her vision. The state's approach is comprehensive, touching every aspect of the crypto ecosystem.

### **Revolutionary Banking Charter: The SPDI Framework**

Wyoming's most groundbreaking innovation is the Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter, which allows crypto companies to operate as banks. Kraken was approved for the world's first SPDI charter, becoming "the first digital asset company in U.S. history to receive a bank charter recognized under federal and state law".

Unlike traditional banks, SPDIs are prohibited from making loans with customer deposits and must maintain 100% reserves, with $15 million upfront to protect customers if the digital asset bank were to fail. This framework bridges the gap between crypto and traditional banking while maintaining the security standards users expect.

The results speak for themselves: Wyoming has now chartered two new banks in less than two months; before September, the last newly chartered bank in Wyoming was approved over a decade ago. **[Kraken Bank](https://www.kraken.com/bank)** focuses on individual consumers while **[Custodia Bank](https://www.custodiabank.com)** (formerly Avanti) targets institutional investors, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for different market segments.

### **Legal Recognition for DAOs: Democracy Meets Blockchain**

Wyoming didn't stop with banking. The state has become the Delaware of DAOs with new crypto law for decentralized autonomous organizations, providing legal frameworks that other states lack entirely.

Wyoming has passed a law recognizing blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as legal entities, moving away from treating them as simple LLCs. The new **[Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/HB0101)** provides a legal framework for DAOs with at least 100 members to become unincorporated nonprofit associations.

This legislation matters because DAOs are often composed of anonymous members and differ significantly from traditional businesses, creating compliance challenges that Wyoming's framework directly addresses.

### **The State Stablecoin: Beating the Fed to Digital Currency**

Perhaps Wyoming's most audacious move is launching its own digital currency. The state is creating its own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, called the Wyoming stable token, which it plans to launch in the first quarter of 2025.

The Wyoming legislature in 2023 authorized a new state commission to issue redeemable Wyoming Stable Tokens (WYST) against reserves consisting exclusively of U.S. Treasury bills in the amount of 100% to 102% of outstanding tokens. Wyoming plans launch its own cryptocurrency as soon as July, making it the first fiat-backed and fully-reserved stable token issued by a US entity.

The vision is practical: "When you walk into Cowboy Coffee in Jackson, Wyoming, and you want to buy your latte, there's going to be their wallet there in Solana that you can use to buy your coffee with the Wyoming token," explained Flavia Naves, a commissioner at the Wyoming Stable Token Commission.

## **The State's Strategic Bitcoin Move**

Wyoming isn't just talking about crypto adoption—they're putting money behind it. "Wyoming took its first bold step toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve," when the state introduced a bill allowing "a portion of Wyoming state funds to be invested in Bitcoin".

The bill proposed that the Wyoming state treasurer may use the general fund, the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and the permanent land fund to invest in Bitcoin; however, no more than 3% could be allocated to Bitcoin under each fund. Importantly, if the total market value of Bitcoin investments surpasses the 3% limit, the state treasurer "shall not be required to sell or otherwise reduce the investments to comply with the limits"—effectively creating a no-sell policy.

## **A Comprehensive Legal Framework**

Wyoming's approach is notable for its comprehensiveness. The state's key legislation includes **[HB 19](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0019)**, exempting cryptocurrencies from the Money Transmitter Act, and **[HB 70](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0070)**, differentiating utility tokens from traditional securities. HB 101 encourages blockchain applications in business, while HB 126 and SF 111 focus on series LLCs and tax exemptions for virtual currencies.

They've enacted about 30 since 2019. The Cowboy State continues to try and attract business from companies interested in blockchain, which is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

This regulatory clarity provides something most crypto businesses desperately need: certainty. Wyoming's Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDIs) charter allows crypto companies to operate as banks, providing them with access to banking services traditionally unavailable to the industry.

## **The Federal Breakthrough Moment**

The pieces are now falling into place for Wyoming's vision to go national. With David Sacks as Crypto Czar, this will be the most pro-digital asset administration ever, according to Lummis, who looks forward to working closely with Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and her strategic bitcoin reserve.

The timing couldn't be better. Pennsylvania, Texas, Ohio, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Massachusetts have all put forward a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill, showing how Wyoming's leadership is inspiring national adoption.

The bill solidifies President Trump's commitment to making the United States the "crypto capital of the world", fulfilling his pledge to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and protect individual financial freedoms.

## **The Delaware Parallel: Building a Business Empire**

Wyoming's crypto strategy mirrors Delaware's corporate dominance. Delaware has long been recognized as the corporate haven of the United States, attracting over 66% of Fortune 500 companies due to its business-friendly laws. Wyoming is following the same playbook for crypto.

Wyoming is emerging as a Delaware for cryptocurrency and blockchain operators, offering regulatory clarity, business-friendly laws, and specialized infrastructure that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in America.

The results are already showing: Wyoming's progressive stance on DAOs contrasts with other states imposing stricter regulations on blockchain companies, such as mandatory money transmitter licenses and adherence to securities laws.

## **The Challenges and Criticisms**

Not everyone is convinced Wyoming's approach is sound. Critics argue that cryptocurrencies in the long term clearly will be connected with authoritarianism and surveillance states, along with a rejection of traditional government, and question whether replacing fossil fuel dependence with crypto speculation is wise economic policy.

Custodia Bank (formerly Avanti Bank) and Kraken Bank have been in a holding pattern for two and a half years as they wait for Federal Reserve master accounts, highlighting the ongoing tension between state innovation and federal approval.

But Wyoming proponents remain confident. Sen. Cynthia Lummis brought the matter up during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's confirmation hearing, expressing concern about "the manner in which Wyoming's SPDIs are being treated by the Federal Reserve".

## **The Economic Vision: Beyond Speculation**

Governor Mark Gordon sees crypto as more than investment speculation. "One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt, because if it's bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree", Gordon explained.

The state's approach focuses on practical utility rather than speculation. Consumer payments, in many cases via stablecoins, are widely seen as the killer app for crypto and gateway to mainstream adoption of this technology.

## **The Network Effect: Attracting Innovation**

Wyoming's comprehensive approach is creating a network effect. Digital banks provide support for digital assets, making them easier and safer to use, and allow consumers to track their cryptocurrencies, cash, and other securities in one individualized account.

The SPDI architecture could also encourage other large institutions, such as pension funds, to enter the cryptocurrency market if they see a strong regulatory and security framework underpinning their investments.

## **2025: The Breakout Year**

All signs point to 2025 being Wyoming's breakout moment. The convergence of federal support, state infrastructure, and market maturity creates unprecedented opportunities.

"Digital assets are the future, and if the United States wants to remain a global leader in financial innovation, Congress needs to urgently pass bipartisan legislation establishing a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets and that strengthens the U.S. dollar with a strategic bitcoin reserve", Lummis declared.

With Wyoming's infrastructure in place and federal winds shifting in favor of crypto adoption, the Cowboy State is positioned to become America's crypto capital—not through flashy marketing campaigns, but through methodical execution of a comprehensive vision.

## **The Wyoming Model: A Blueprint for America**

Wyoming's success comes from treating crypto as infrastructure rather than speculation. By providing legal clarity, banking services, and regulatory certainty, the state has created conditions for sustainable growth rather than boom-bust cycles.

The least populated state's select committee on blockchain has put forth dozens of pieces of legislation over the last five years, creating a comprehensive framework that addresses every aspect of crypto adoption.

As other states scramble to catch up and federal policy finally aligns with innovation, Wyoming and Cynthia Lummis have proven that methodical execution beats reactive policymaking. The Cowboy State didn't just get lucky—they built the future of American finance, one law at a time.

The question now isn't whether crypto will become mainstream in America—Wyoming has already made that inevitable. The question is whether other states can catch up to the comprehensive infrastructure the Cowboy State has been building all along.

In the battle for America's crypto future, Wyoming isn't just winning—they've already built the infrastructure to ensure victory. And with Cynthia Lummis now chairing the Senate subcommittee on digital assets, the Wyoming model is about to become the American model.
