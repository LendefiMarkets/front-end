# The One-Inch Punch: How Sergey Kunz Built DeFi's Trading Gateway

Sergey Kunz was thirteen years old when he received his first computer. While his friends played games, he did something unusual—he immediately disassembled it, piece by piece, determined to understand how the machine worked. Without internet access at home, the teenager walked to libraries to download programming tutorials, teaching himself to code through sheer determination. By seventeen, his self-taught skills were sophisticated enough to land freelance web development gigs. Today, the programmer who never earned a university degree has built one of DeFi's most critical infrastructure pieces: [1inch Network](https://1inch.io/), which has processed over $500 billion in trading volume and serves 24 million users worldwide.

The story of 1inch begins not with venture capital or prestigious accelerators, but with two developers sleeping in hackathon venues and using prize money to fund travel to the next competition. It's a tale of technical obsession meeting real-world problems, of a fortunate typo that changed everything, and of how a 60-hour coding marathon created technology that would reshape decentralized finance.

## From SMS aggregation to blockchain fascination

Before crypto captured his imagination, Kunz demonstrated an early instinct for optimization that would later define 1inch. In 2014, while working full-time as a programmer, he built an SMS aggregation system in his spare time—a platform that automatically found the best rates for sending text messages across multiple providers. This side project became his first business venture, revealing a pattern that would repeat throughout his career: identifying inefficiencies in fragmented markets and building technology to solve them.

His corporate career took him through Germany's industrial giants. After starting as a programmer at Commerce Connector, a Stuttgart-based price aggregator, Kunz moved into consulting at Mimacom, where he ran projects for [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com/), [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/), and [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/). A project with Porsche impressed the luxury automaker enough to offer him a full-time position. By 2019, he had achieved [AWS certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) and was transitioning from DevOps into cybersecurity—a comfortable corporate trajectory that many would envy.

But Kunz had discovered cryptocurrency. His first exposure came in 2012 through mining, though he wasn't deeply engaged. By late 2016, he built his first [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) mining farm, and by 2018, he was, in his words, "hooked by the blockchain and crypto." The security aspects particularly fascinated him, leading to the creation of CryptoManiacs, a Russian-language YouTube channel where he conducted live security audits of smart contracts. This educational venture would prove more consequential than he imagined.

## Meeting of minds through YouTube

Anton Bukov's path to 1inch was equally unconventional. A [Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/) graduate with over twenty years of programming experience, Bukov first encountered blockchain in 2014 while building a spatial arbitrage bot. The bot worked technically but couldn't generate profits due to constant price discrepancies between exchanges—a problem that would later inspire 1inch's core solution.

After leaving blockchain for several years, Bukov returned in 2017, shocked to see tokens he remembered at $30 now trading at $3,000. At a Kazan hackathon featuring [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/), he wrote what he called "probably the most complicated smart contract in his career." This project, later launched as 1Address, demonstrated his aptitude for the exacting standards smart contracts demanded. After stints at [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/) and contributions to [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), a mutual friend introduced him to Kunz's CryptoManiacs channel.

The connection was instant. Bukov joined initially as a viewer but quickly became co-host, and for six months, the two developers explored smart contract security together on air. Their shared obsession with DeFi's technical challenges led to a remarkable decision: they would tackle the global hackathon circuit together.

## Seventeen hackathons and survival mode

What followed was a period Kunz describes as "survival mode." The duo participated in seventeen hackathons worldwide, often sleeping in venues or not sleeping at all. They used prize money from one event to fund travel to the next, a nomadic existence driven by technical passion rather than comfort. A win in Singapore provided funds for the next journey. Two [Ethereum Global](https://ethglobal.com/) awards cemented their reputation in the developer community.

This grueling circuit served multiple purposes. Beyond the prize money that kept them afloat, hackathons provided uninterrupted coding time, exposure to emerging problems in DeFi, and connections with future team members. Most importantly, the pressure-cooker environment of hackathons—where teams have mere hours to identify problems and build solutions—sharpened their ability to spot market inefficiencies.

## Sixty hours that changed DeFi

The [ETHNewYork](https://ethglobal.com/) hackathon in May 2019 began without a clear plan. Hours into the event, as other teams raced ahead with their projects, Kunz and Bukov identified a fundamental problem plaguing DeFi: liquidity fragmentation. Decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Kyber](https://kyber.network/), and [Bancor](https://bancor.network/) operated in isolation, creating price discrepancies and poor user experiences. Traders manually checking each platform for the best rates faced high gas costs and missed opportunities.

"I was not that good with algorithms back in the day," Kunz admits. He turned to Bukov: "We should build an algorithm that could split a swap as correctly as possible, based on mathematics, across multiple exchanges." What emerged over the next 60 sleepless hours was the first DEX aggregator in Web3 history—a tool that automatically found optimal trading paths across multiple exchanges in under one second.

The hackathon judges awarded them only a small prize, failing to recognize the innovation's potential. But Kunz and Bukov knew they had solved something significant. Like searching for the cheapest airfare across multiple airlines, their aggregator removed friction from a fragmented market. All operations happened through smart contracts, maintaining DeFi's core principle of non-custodial trading while dramatically improving efficiency.

## From bouncy beds to billions

The early days of building 1inch tested Kunz's resilience. While developing the platform, he juggled work responsibilities and child support payments, often sleeping on a "bouncy bed" in the office. "In the beginning, it's all about survival," he reflects. The financial pressure was crushing—until a fortunate accident changed everything.

Applying for a $5,000 [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) grant, a typo in their application resulted in receiving $50,000 instead. "Gitcoin played a huge role in shaping our destiny," Kunz acknowledges. The windfall allowed them to pay their development team while allocating "everything towards development and not pocketing a cent." This commitment to reinvestment would characterize 1inch's growth trajectory.

Market validation came quickly. The DeFi community's enthusiastic response attracted attention from major investors. [Binance Labs](https://labs.binance.com/) led a $2.8 million seed round in August 2020, followed by [Pantera Capital](https://panteracapital.com/)'s $12 million Series A in December. The momentum culminated in a $175 million Series B led by [Amber Group](https://www.ambergroup.io/) in December 2021, valuing 1inch at $2.25 billion.

## Building the Pathfinder brain

While funding provided resources, 1inch's competitive moat came from technical innovation. The Pathfinder algorithm, introduced in version 2, revolutionized DEX aggregation by utilizing "market depths"—using different liquidity levels within the same protocol as bridges between tokens. This breakthrough enabled more sophisticated routing than simple cross-DEX splitting, often finding paths competitors missed.

Imagine Pathfinder as an advanced GPS for cryptocurrency trading. Just as GPS considers traffic patterns and road conditions to optimize routes, Pathfinder analyzes liquidity depths, gas costs, and price impact across hundreds of variables. A trade that might go directly from ETH to DAI on a single exchange could instead route through ETH → USDC → DAI across multiple protocols if this path offers better rates, even accounting for additional gas costs.

The team's relentless optimization continued through five major protocol versions. Version 3 achieved the remarkable feat of making 1inch cheaper than using DEXes directly—a 10.3% gas saving for ETH-DAI swaps compared to Uniswap. Version 5, released in 2023, pushed efficiency 10% beyond any competitor while processing transactions like 100,000 USDC to USDT with 24% better efficiency than alternatives.

## Beyond aggregation to intent-based trading

The most radical innovation came with [1inch Fusion](https://1inch.io/fusion/), which reimagined how trades execute. Traditional DEX interactions require users to specify exact execution paths—which pool to use, what route to take, how to handle gas costs. Fusion introduced "intent-based" trading: users simply state their desired outcome ("I want at least 3,000 USDC for my 1 ETH"), and the system handles implementation.

This shift seems subtle but represents a fundamental reimagining of DeFi interaction. Professional "resolvers" compete through a Dutch auction model to fill orders, paying gas fees themselves and sourcing liquidity from any available venue. Users receive guaranteed prices without worrying about technical complexity or gas costs—a user experience approaching centralized exchange simplicity while maintaining self-custody.

Fusion+ extended this concept across blockchains. Using atomic swap technology—where transactions either complete entirely or fail with funds returned—the protocol enables trustless cross-chain trading without bridge risks. When a user wants to swap Ethereum-based USDC for [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)-based tokens, Fusion+ handles the complexity through cryptographic proofs and time-locked escrows, presenting a single-transaction experience.

## The Bruce Lee connection

The name "1inch" originated from Bruce Lee's famous one-inch punch demonstration—a technique showing how proper form could generate tremendous power from minimal distance. This philosophy of maximum efficiency from minimum movement perfectly captured the protocol's approach to trading optimization. In October 2024, this connection deepened through a partnership with the [Bruce Lee Family Company](https://www.brucelee.com/).

"Take crypto seriousLee," the campaign urged, with Shannon Lee and Kunz promoting cryptocurrency's evolution from speculation to fundamental financial infrastructure. The collaboration reflected 1inch's broader mission: making DeFi accessible to mainstream users while maintaining the philosophical principles both Bruce Lee and blockchain represent—individual empowerment through disciplined technique.

## Scaling beyond Ethereum's borders

By 2024, 1inch operated across twelve blockchains, adapting its technology to each network's characteristics. The April 2025 [Solana](https://solana.com/) integration marked a pivotal expansion, bringing 1inch's aggregation to over one million Solana-based tokens. With Solana processing five billion transactions to Ethereum's one billion, the integration required significant architectural adaptations while maintaining the security standards users expected.

Multi-chain expansion created new challenges around liquidity fragmentation. A user holding USDC on Ethereum wanting to buy a token only available on Polygon faced multiple transactions, bridge risks, and complexity. Fusion+ solved this through atomic swaps, aggregating liquidity across all supported networks while presenting users with single-transaction simplicity.

## Building tomorrow's financial infrastructure

Today, 1inch processes approximately $400 million daily across its protocol suite. The platform Kunz and Bukov built in 60 hours now employs over 150 contributors worldwide, maintains offices from Dubai to decentralized locations, and serves as critical infrastructure for DeFi's growth. The [1inch Card](https://1inch.io/card/) partnership with [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com/) bridges traditional and decentralized finance, enabling crypto-to-fiat conversion at millions of merchants worldwide.

Yet Kunz remains focused on core principles. "We need to build frameworks to protect users' privacy and anonymity," he emphasizes, viewing 1inch's role as broader than trading optimization. The protocol's governance token, distributed to users rather than sold, reflects commitment to decentralization. The [DAO structure](https://1inch.io/dao/) ensures community control over protocol development, with users staking tokens to participate in governance and earn yields from resolver operations.

Recent developments showcase continued innovation. The [1inch Developer Portal](https://portal.1inch.dev/) provides free API access to aggregation technology, enabling any application to integrate professional-grade trading. Portfolio tracking across multiple chains, integration with hardware wallets for security, and advanced MEV protection demonstrate comprehensive ecosystem thinking beyond pure aggregation.

## The aggregator economy's architect

The DEX aggregator market 1inch pioneered now processes billions monthly, with 1inch maintaining approximately 59% market share despite competition from [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/), [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/), and [CoW Swap](https://cow.fi/). This dominance stems not from first-mover advantage alone but from continuous innovation—each protocol version solving new problems while maintaining backward compatibility.

Kunz's vision extends beyond market leadership. Institutional adoption through partnerships with [Galaxy Digital](https://www.galaxydigital.com/) and [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) brings professional trading firms into DeFi. Educational initiatives preserve the CryptoManiacs spirit of technical knowledge sharing. The [1inch Foundation](https://1inch.foundation/)'s grant program, allocated $3 million by Kunz personally, funds ecosystem development.

The numbers tell a remarkable story: from zero to $500 billion in cumulative volume, from two developers to 24 million users, from a hackathon project to processing more volume than many centralized exchanges. But Kunz measures success differently. "It turned out that we managed to solve a big problem in DeFi," he says simply, maintaining the humble recognition that characterized his journey from dismantling computers to building critical financial infrastructure.

## One inch forward, miles ahead

As DeFi matures from experimental technology to parallel financial system, 1inch's role evolves from aggregator to ecosystem enabler. Cross-chain functionality removes blockchain boundaries. Intent-based architecture abstracts technical complexity. Professional market makers provide liquidity depth. Each innovation brings DeFi closer to Kunz's vision: financial tools accessible to anyone, controlled by users, optimized by mathematics rather than intermediaries.

The self-taught programmer who walked to libraries for internet access now leads development of infrastructure processing billions in value. The consultant who left corporate comfort for hackathon survival mode built technology essential to DeFi's operation. From SMS aggregation revealing market inefficiencies to Pathfinder optimizing global liquidity, Kunz's career demonstrates how identifying fundamental problems and building elegant solutions creates lasting value.

Standing at his desk—he still prefers coding to corporate meetings—Kunz embodies the builder ethos that defined early DeFi. No university validated his knowledge. No accelerator guided his path. Just curiosity about how things work, determination to solve real problems, and belief that technology should empower users rather than extract from them. In an industry often criticized for speculation over substance, 1inch represents something different: infrastructure so essential that DeFi would struggle to function efficiently without it.

The one-inch punch that Bruce Lee demonstrated required years of training to generate maximum impact from minimal movement. Similarly, 1inch Network's elegant aggregation masks enormous complexity—hundreds of liquidity sources, sophisticated routing algorithms, cross-chain coordination—presented through interfaces simple enough for mainstream adoption. This balance of power and accessibility, of technical sophistication and user simplicity, defines both Kunz's creation and DeFi's future. From thirteen-year-old dismantling his first computer to architect of decentralized trading infrastructure, Sergey Kunz's journey proves that the most revolutionary innovations often come from those who simply refuse to accept that existing systems are good enough.
