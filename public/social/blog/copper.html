                    <h1>The Custody Architect: How Dmitry Tokarev Built the Bridge Between Traditional Finance and Crypto</h1>
<p>In the bustling financial district of Mayfair, London, Dmitry Tokarev faced a problem that would reshape institutional cryptocurrency investing. As Chief Technology Officer and Partner at <a href="https://dolfin.com/">Dolfin Financial</a>, a traditional asset management firm, he watched institutional clients increasingly interested in digital assets but paralyzed by fundamental infrastructure gaps. Traditional custody solutions couldn't handle crypto's unique characteristics, while crypto-native platforms lacked the security and compliance standards that institutional investors required.</p>
<p>The solution that emerged from this challenge would become <a href="https://copper.co/">Copper.co</a>, one of the world's leading digital asset custody providers, serving over 500 institutional clients and managing billions in digital assets. Today, Copper's <a href="https://copper.co/en/products/clearloop">ClearLoop</a> network processes thousands of trades daily, enabling institutions to trade cryptocurrency while maintaining bank-level security and regulatory compliance. From quantitative analyst to custody pioneer, Tokarev's journey reveals how traditional finance expertise combined with deep technical understanding can create the infrastructure that transforms entire industries.</p>
<h2>From Quantitative Foundations to Digital Frontiers</h2>
<p>Dmitry Tokarev's path to crypto custody began in the rigorous halls of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, where he earned his Master's degree in Risk Management and Financial Engineering with distinction in 2012. The program's combination of mathematical precision and practical financial application provided the intellectual framework that would later prove essential for designing institutional-grade crypto infrastructure.</p>
<p>His academic focus on risk management wasn't merely theoretical—it reflected a deep understanding that financial innovation must be built on solid foundations of security and operational excellence. The skills he developed in quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and systematic risk assessment would prove directly applicable to crypto's unique challenges: extreme volatility, 24/7 markets, and the need for immutable transaction security.</p>
<p>Starting his career as a quantitative analyst in London's competitive financial sector, Tokarev quickly demonstrated an ability to translate complex mathematical concepts into practical trading systems. His early work involved building algorithms that could process vast amounts of market data, identify opportunities, and execute trades within strict risk parameters—precisely the skill set that crypto markets would eventually demand at institutional scale.</p>
<p>The transition from quantitative analysis to technology leadership came naturally. Financial firms increasingly recognized that competitive advantage came not just from better models, but from superior technology implementation. Tokarev's combination of mathematical rigor and programming expertise made him an ideal candidate to bridge the gap between theoretical finance and practical system architecture.</p>
<h2>Building Traditional Finance Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The opportunity to join Dolfin Financial as Chief Technology Officer and Partner marked a pivotal moment in Tokarev's career. Dolfin, a sophisticated Mayfair-based asset manager, provided exposure to the operational complexities of institutional investment management at the highest levels. The firm's clientele—family offices, pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals—demanded not just strong returns but operational excellence, regulatory compliance, and absolute security.</p>
<p>As CTO, Tokarev was responsible for building and maintaining the technological infrastructure that enabled complex investment strategies across traditional asset classes. This role required deep understanding of custody systems, trade settlement, regulatory reporting, and risk management—all areas that would prove essential for institutional crypto adoption. The experience taught him that successful financial technology must seamlessly integrate with existing operational workflows rather than requiring complete system overhauls.</p>
<p>More importantly, his position as Partner gave him direct exposure to client concerns and institutional decision-making processes. He observed firsthand how institutional investors evaluated new opportunities, the due diligence processes they required, and the operational standards they expected. This insight would prove invaluable when designing crypto solutions for similar institutional clients.</p>
<p>The gap in the market became increasingly apparent as Dolfin's clients expressed growing interest in cryptocurrency investments. Despite the asset class's potential returns, institutional participation remained limited by infrastructure constraints. Existing crypto platforms lacked the security architecture, regulatory compliance, and operational integration that institutional investors required. Traditional custody providers, meanwhile, had no viable framework for handling digital assets.</p>
<p>"It was there he observed a gap in the market for Copper.co," Tokarev later reflected, "as he found there were no feasible options available to institutional investors that provided the necessary security, control and speed for storing and trading digital assets." This observation would drive his decision to leave the comfort of traditional finance and venture into crypto's uncharted territories.</p>
<h2>Founding Copper: The Institutional Imperative</h2>
<p>In January 2018, as crypto markets experienced unprecedented retail attention and institutional curiosity, Tokarev made the bold decision to found Copper. The timing proved prescient—while retail speculation dominated headlines, sophisticated investors were quietly evaluating crypto's long-term potential and searching for professional-grade infrastructure to facilitate their participation.</p>
<p>The company's name reflected its mission: copper has been a fundamental building material for centuries, providing the infrastructure that enables electrical systems to function reliably. Similarly, Copper would provide the foundational infrastructure that enables institutional investors to engage with digital assets safely and efficiently. The metaphor captured Tokarev's vision of crypto custody as essential infrastructure rather than speculative technology.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Copper was designed with institutional standards in mind. Rather than adapting consumer-focused crypto solutions for institutional use, Tokarev built entirely new systems architected around institutional requirements: segregated custody, robust compliance frameworks, integration with existing operational systems, and the security standards expected by fiduciaries managing other people's money.</p>
<p>The early challenge was enormous. Crypto markets operated 24/7 across multiple time zones and dozens of exchanges, each with different technical specifications and operational requirements. Digital assets required entirely new approaches to key management, transaction signing, and audit trails. Most importantly, the infrastructure had to provide institutional-level security while enabling the speed and flexibility that crypto markets demanded.</p>
<p>Tokarev's approach reflected his traditional finance background: build comprehensive systems architecture first, then optimize for performance. This methodology, while slower than typical crypto startup approaches, would prove essential for earning institutional trust and regulatory acceptance. The firm's early clients included crypto funds and family offices—sophisticated investors who valued operational excellence over marketing hype.</p>
<h2>Revolutionary Technology: The ClearLoop Innovation</h2>
<p>The breakthrough innovation that would define Copper's competitive advantage came through the development of ClearLoop, launched in May 2020. This technology solved one of institutional crypto trading's most fundamental problems: the need to deposit assets on exchanges before trading, creating counterparty risk and operational inefficiency.</p>
<p>Traditional crypto trading required investors to transfer digital assets from secure custody wallets to exchange hot wallets—a process that could take between 10 minutes to one hour for blockchain confirmations. These delays were exacerbated by withdrawal times post-trade, creating significant operational friction and exposure to exchange counterparty risk. For institutional investors accustomed to efficient traditional markets, this process was unacceptable.</p>
<p>ClearLoop revolutionized this dynamic by enabling off-exchange settlement that completed in under 100 milliseconds. The system ensured that both clients and exchanges had sufficient assets allocated before positions were opened, then settled trades instantly between parties after execution. Most importantly, client assets never left Copper's secure custody during the trading process, eliminating exchange counterparty risk while maintaining trading efficiency.</p>
<p>The technical architecture underlying ClearLoop represented a fundamental reimagining of crypto market structure. Rather than requiring asset transfer for trading, the system created a secure trading loop connecting multiple exchanges through Copper's custody infrastructure. This approach provided the speed and efficiency of centralized trading with the security and control of decentralized custody.</p>
<p>Integration with leading exchanges validated the concept. <a href="https://www.deribit.com/">Deribit</a>, handling 85% of crypto options volume, became an early adopter, followed by <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://www.aax.com/">AAX</a>, and other major platforms. Each integration expanded the network effects, making ClearLoop more valuable for all participants as liquidity and trading opportunities increased across connected venues.</p>
<p>The institutional response was immediate and enthusiastic. "ClearLoop has become a critical component in helping institutional investors mitigate exchange counterparty risk," noted one client. The technology enabled institutional trading strategies that were previously impossible, such as cross-exchange arbitrage and sophisticated hedging programs, while maintaining the security standards that fiduciaries required.</p>
<h2>Securing Institutional Capital: The Funding Journey</h2>
<p>Copper's institutional approach to product development attracted equally sophisticated investors. The company's seed funding round in 2019 was led by <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> and <a href="https://mmc.vc/">MMC Ventures</a>, two prominent London-based venture capital firms with strong track records in fintech investing. The early validation from respected institutional investors signaled market confidence in Copper's long-term vision.</p>
<p>The Series A round in February 2020, led by <a href="https://www.target-global.com/">Target Global</a>, raised the stakes considerably. Target Global's investment thesis reflected growing institutional interest in crypto infrastructure, particularly solutions that could bridge traditional finance and digital assets. The timing proved fortunate, occurring just before COVID-19 accelerated institutional digital adoption across all sectors.</p>
<p>However, it was the $50 million Series B round in May 2021 that marked Copper's emergence as a major player in institutional crypto infrastructure. Co-led by <a href="https://dawncapital.com/">Dawn Capital</a> and Target Global, the round included participation from <a href="https://www.illuminate.com/">Illuminate Financial Management</a>, a specialist enterprise fintech investor, along with existing investors LocalGlobe and MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Josh Bell, General Partner at Dawn Capital, captured the investment rationale: "With the proliferation of institutional investment in digital assets over the last few years, we had been tracking Copper since its entry to the market just three years ago. It is rare to find a team that so expertly understands not only traditional asset management, but that of digital assets and how to marry the two worlds to provide institutional-grade infrastructure that truly meets investors' requirements."</p>
<p>The Series B funding enabled aggressive international expansion, with Copper opening offices in New York, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi to serve global institutional clients. The firm also tripled its headcount, hiring extensively from traditional financial institutions to bring institutional expertise to crypto infrastructure development.</p>
<p>The culmination of Copper's funding journey came through a massive $681 million Series C round across two tranches in 2022, valuing the company at $2 billion and establishing it as a crypto unicorn. Major investors included <a href="https://www.tigergobal.com/">Tiger Global Management</a> and <a href="https://www.barclays.com/">Barclays</a>, with the latter's participation particularly significant as validation from a major traditional financial institution.</p>
<h2>Multi-Party Computation: Security Through Mathematics</h2>
<p>At the heart of Copper's institutional appeal lies its implementation of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, representing the gold standard in secure digital asset custody. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency wallets that store private keys in single locations, MPC distributes cryptographic key material across multiple parties, eliminating single points of failure while maintaining operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Copper's MPC implementation creates key shards distributed across three separate entities: the client, Copper, and a trusted third party. This architecture requires two-out-of-three consensus for any transaction, providing natural redundancy while ensuring that no single party can unilaterally move assets. At no point is the complete private key assembled, making the system resistant to both external attacks and internal threats.</p>
<p>The security model extends beyond key management to encompass comprehensive operational safeguards. Copper's solution keeps client funds in segregated vaults at the blockchain level across 60+ networks and 600+ digital assets. The company's Policy Engine enables clients to configure role-based controls, setting user-specific transaction limits, approval workflows, and time-based restrictions tailored to their operational requirements.</p>
<p>For institutions requiring maximum security, Copper provides cold vault options utilizing optical air-gap technology. Cold wallet transactions require manual approval from both client-side users and Copper account managers, with the company's 24/7/365 client services team ensuring that even cold vault transactions execute within minutes rather than hours.</p>
<p>Insurance coverage from A+ rated providers adds another layer of institutional protection. Copper's insurance policies, among the strongest in the crypto custody industry, provide financial protection against various risk scenarios while maintaining the transparency and accountability that institutional clients require for their own regulatory and fiduciary obligations.</p>
<h2>Global Expansion and Regulatory Leadership</h2>
<p>Copper's growth strategy emphasized regulatory compliance and global expansion from the beginning. Unlike many crypto firms that operated in regulatory gray areas, Tokarev prioritized working with regulators to establish clear frameworks for institutional participation in digital asset markets.</p>
<p>The firm achieved <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/">Swiss licensing</a> early in its development, providing regulatory clarity for European operations. Switzerland's progressive approach to crypto regulation, combined with its traditional role as a global financial center, made it an ideal base for serving international institutional clients. The Zug office became a hub for product development and client service across European markets.</p>
<p>Expansion into Asia followed through the Singapore office, positioning Copper to serve the region's growing institutional crypto adoption. Singapore's clear regulatory framework and role as a gateway to Asian capital markets made it essential for serving family offices, asset managers, and corporate treasuries throughout the region.</p>
<p>The recent acquisition of <a href="https://securrency.com/">Securrency Capital</a> added significant presence in Abu Dhabi, reflecting the Middle East's emergence as a major crypto adoption region. Abu Dhabi's progressive Digital Asset Framework and position as a global financial hub made it strategically important for serving sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors across the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, Copper obtained a license in Hong Kong, positioning the firm to serve Chinese institutional capital as regulatory frameworks evolved. Hong Kong's role as a bridge between Chinese capital and global markets made this licensing achievement particularly valuable for long-term growth.</p>
<p>The regulatory achievements reflected Tokarev's strategic vision that sustainable competitive advantage in institutional crypto services would come through regulatory leadership rather than regulatory arbitrage. By working proactively with regulators, Copper established itself as a trusted partner for institutions navigating crypto adoption while maintaining compliance with evolving regulatory requirements.</p>
<h2>The Network Effect: ClearLoop's Growing Ecosystem</h2>
<p>ClearLoop's success created powerful network effects that accelerated Copper's growth throughout 2021-2023. As more exchanges integrated with the platform, it became more valuable for institutional traders, creating virtuous cycles of adoption and liquidity growth.</p>
<p>Major exchange partnerships validated ClearLoop's institutional value proposition. <a href="https://www.bitget.com/">Bitget's</a> integration in 2023 brought Asian retail liquidity to institutional traders, while partnerships with <a href="https://www.okx.com/">OKX</a> and other tier-1 exchanges expanded global market access. Each new integration increased the platform's utility for existing clients while attracting new institutional participants.</p>
<p>The partnership with <a href="https://www.flowtraders.com/">Flow Traders</a>, a leading market maker, marked ClearLoop's evolution into institutional trading infrastructure. Flow Traders' full integration demonstrated that professional trading firms could rely on Copper's infrastructure for their core operations, validating the platform's scalability and reliability under institutional workloads.</p>
<p>Collaboration with <a href="https://www.wyden.io/">Wyden</a>, an institutional trading technology provider, created seamless workflows between trading platforms and custody infrastructure. This integration eliminated operational friction that had historically limited institutional participation in crypto markets, enabling portfolio managers to access digital assets through familiar institutional interfaces.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, the partnership with <a href="https://komainu.com/">Komainu</a>, another major custody provider, demonstrated ClearLoop's evolution into multi-custodian infrastructure. This development transformed ClearLoop from Copper-specific technology into industry-standard settlement infrastructure, similar to traditional finance clearing and settlement systems.</p>
<p>The network's growth metrics reflected its institutional adoption: over 600 active counterparties utilizing settlement services, thousands of daily transactions, and billions in assets under management. These numbers demonstrated that ClearLoop had achieved the scale and reliability necessary to serve as core financial market infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Prime Services and Traditional Finance Integration</h2>
<p>Recognizing that institutional clients required comprehensive service offerings beyond custody, Copper launched its Prime Services division in 2022. This expansion reflected Tokarev's understanding that successful institutional crypto firms needed to provide the full range of services that clients expected from traditional prime brokers.</p>
<p>Prime Services encompassed lending, borrowing, and sophisticated risk management tools that enabled institutional trading strategies previously impossible in crypto markets. Clients could access leverage for trading strategies, earn yield on digital asset holdings, and implement complex hedging programs while maintaining custody security.</p>
<p>The launch of <a href="https://copper.co/en/copper-securities">Copper Securities</a> in the UAE represented a significant evolution toward traditional finance integration. This platform enabled institutions to trade and custody tokenized securities, benefiting from blockchain efficiency while maintaining regulatory compliance. The service bridged traditional securities markets and digital asset infrastructure, creating new opportunities for institutional portfolio diversification.</p>
<p>Integration with traditional finance accelerated through partnerships with established financial institutions. Copper's collaboration with major banks enabled institutional clients to access crypto services through familiar counterparties, reducing operational complexity while maintaining existing relationships and compliance procedures.</p>
<p>The firm's hiring strategy reflected this traditional finance focus. Copper recruited extensively from <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href="https://www.bofaml.com/">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/">Citi</a>, and other premier institutions, bringing traditional finance expertise to crypto infrastructure development. These hires understood institutional client requirements and operational standards essential for mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Most recently, Copper announced the <a href="https://copper.co/en/copper-network">Copper Network</a>, the industry's first custodian-agnostic digital asset settlement network. This development represents the ultimate evolution of Tokarev's vision: creating settlement infrastructure that serves the entire institutional crypto ecosystem rather than just Copper clients.</p>
<h2>The Leadership Transition: From Founder to Legacy</h2>
<p>In October 2024, Dmitry Tokarev made the strategic decision to step down as CEO while remaining closely involved as Founder Director and controlling shareholder. The transition to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amarkuchinad/">Amar Kuchinad</a>, a veteran of <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/">Credit Suisse</a> and Goldman Sachs with extensive SEC experience, reflected Copper's evolution into a mature financial services institution.</p>
<p>The leadership change was carefully orchestrated to maintain continuity while adding complementary expertise for Copper's next growth phase. Kuchinad's background in traditional finance regulation and his experience founding <a href="https://electronifie.com/">Electronifie</a>, an SEC-registered bond trading platform, brought precisely the skills needed for Copper's expansion into traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>"We covered all bases to find the right candidate for this vitally important role," Tokarev noted, "and I know that Amar is ideally placed to ensure Copper's continued long-term success. As our Board's Founder Director, I will continue to be closely involved as we embark on this pivotal new chapter and the next phase of our company's evolution."</p>
<p>The transition reflected broader market dynamics as crypto infrastructure matured from startup innovation to essential financial infrastructure. Tokarev's technical and product development expertise had built the foundation; Kuchinad's regulatory and traditional finance experience would drive mainstream adoption and regulatory integration.</p>
<p>Former UK Chancellor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-hammond-681b3b11/">Philip Hammond</a>, Copper's Chairman, emphasized the strategic nature of the transition: "His skill sets and experience provide the perfect complement to Dmitry's technical strengths as we deploy our industry-leading technology to support global financial institutions to trade and safeguard digital assets of all kinds."</p>
<h2>Recognition and Industry Leadership</h2>
<p>Throughout Copper's development, Tokarev established himself as a thought leader in institutional crypto adoption. His recognition from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> as a significant figure in digital assets and his invitation to join the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a> as a Unicorn under the Digital Asset and Blockchain platform validated his contributions to the industry's maturation.</p>
<p>Central banks and global regulatory bodies regularly sought Tokarev's input on digital asset policy development. His unique perspective, combining deep technical understanding with institutional operational experience, made him a valued advisor for regulators designing frameworks for institutional crypto adoption. This advisory role enhanced Copper's regulatory relationships while contributing to industry-wide policy development.</p>
<p>Academic recognition came through his ongoing relationship with Imperial College, where he regularly spoke about digital asset market structure and institutional adoption trends. His <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/events/imperial-digitalks-market-structure-digital-assets-2022-and-beyond-dmitry-tokarev/">2022 DigiTalk</a> on "Market Structure for Digital Assets in 2022 and Beyond" articulated his vision for crypto's evolution from speculative asset to institutional infrastructure.</p>
<p>The presentation highlighted key themes that would define crypto's institutional future: the need for new infrastructure to address digital asset risks, the expansion beyond cryptocurrencies to include Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized securities, and the critical role of decentralized finance in traditional financial services evolution.</p>
<p>Industry awards and recognition validated Copper's technological achievements. The firm's multi-award-winning custody architecture received recognition from major industry publications and trade organizations, establishing Copper as the institutional standard for digital asset infrastructure.</p>
<h2>The Future of Institutional Crypto Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Under new leadership but with Tokarev's continued strategic involvement, Copper is positioning itself for the next phase of institutional crypto adoption. The firm's strategic shift toward applying blockchain technology to traditional finance reflects broader market evolution as crypto infrastructure matures into mainstream financial services.</p>
<p>The pursuit of US regulatory licenses, including New York's BitLicense, demonstrates Copper's commitment to serving American institutional markets. With the election of pro-crypto leadership and improving regulatory clarity, US expansion represents significant growth opportunities for institutional crypto infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>Copper's technology roadmap emphasizes integration with existing traditional finance systems rather than replacement. This approach reflects Tokarev's original insight that successful crypto adoption requires seamless integration with established institutional workflows and regulatory frameworks rather than revolutionary disruption.</p>
<p>The Copper Network's evolution into custodian-agnostic infrastructure represents the ultimate realization of Tokarev's vision: creating the settlement and custody infrastructure that enables institutional crypto adoption at global scale. Like traditional finance clearing and settlement systems, this infrastructure operates behind the scenes, enabling efficient markets while maintaining security and regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2>Legacy of Institutional Innovation</h2>
<p>Dmitry Tokarev's journey from quantitative analyst to crypto custody pioneer illustrates how traditional finance expertise can unlock digital asset adoption at institutional scale. His recognition that crypto's institutional future required purpose-built infrastructure rather than adapted consumer solutions created the foundation for one of the industry's most successful custody providers.</p>
<p>The numbers validate this approach: over 500 institutional clients, billions in assets under management, offices across major financial centers, and integration with dozens of exchanges and trading platforms. More importantly, Copper's success enabled institutional participation in crypto markets that might otherwise have remained inaccessible due to infrastructure limitations.</p>
<p>Tokarev's emphasis on regulatory cooperation rather than regulatory arbitrage established a model for sustainable crypto business development. By working proactively with regulators and maintaining traditional finance operational standards, Copper earned institutional trust while contributing to industry-wide policy development.</p>
<p>The ClearLoop innovation represents perhaps Tokarev's most significant contribution to crypto market structure. By solving the fundamental problem of exchange counterparty risk while maintaining trading efficiency, ClearLoop enabled institutional trading strategies that transformed crypto from retail speculation to institutional asset class.</p>
<p>Standing in Copper's London headquarters, surrounded by monitors displaying real-time custody operations across global markets, the infrastructure Tokarev built represents more than technological achievement. It embodies the bridge between traditional finance's institutional standards and crypto's innovative potential, enabling mainstream adoption while maintaining the security and compliance that institutional clients require.</p>
<p>From Imperial College's academic foundations through Dolfin's institutional experience to Copper's crypto innovation, Tokarev's career demonstrates how disciplined technical development combined with deep institutional understanding can create the infrastructure that transforms entire industries. His legacy lies not just in the company he built, but in the institutional confidence that enables pension funds, family offices, and asset managers to participate in digital asset markets with the same security and professionalism they expect from traditional investments.</p>
<p>The custody revolution that began with a gap in Mayfair's traditional finance landscape has evolved into global infrastructure serving hundreds of institutions and managing billions in digital assets. As crypto continues its evolution from experimental technology to established asset class, the institutional infrastructure that Dmitry Tokarev pioneered provides the foundation that makes mainstream adoption possible, secure, and sustainable.</p>
